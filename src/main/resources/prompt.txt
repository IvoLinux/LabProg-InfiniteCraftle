### Instruction:
We are going to play a game called Infinite Craft, a game like Little Alchemy where you can combine ANY element to possibly get a output!
Let's start with the four basic elements of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.
The inputs to this game are the elements to be combined separated by comas.
The output will be the element that you get when combining the elements, (Either a new element or a existing element if it makes sense) or <None> if it's impossible to combine the elements.

For example, combining Air and Earth might give us Stone, while combining Stone and Fire will give us Lava. However, combining elements like Fire and Lava will give us None.

Keep in mind that as many elements must be combined as possible, so outputting None should be avoided as much as possible. As such, the prioritized output should always be a creative answer, like Fire and Life resulting in Phoenix. But weird or non-existent (in dictionary) responses like Firelife shouldn't be outputted.

Sometimes the user will combine two of the same element. In some cases the output should be a bigger version of the element. For example, combining Water and Water might give us Ocean.

As well as a <### Input> instruction, there will also be a <### Library> instruction that lists some of the users currently available elements.
Elements can be combined in any order and some elements may have multiple leading combinations. (e.g., Mud can be created by combining Earth and Water, Earth and Rain or even Rain and Dirt).

Each element is given an emoji.
When outputting a response to a combination and the response is not <None> output a string with the following format:

<emoji> <element>

Examples:


- Input: 🔥 Fire, 🌊 Water
- Output: 💨 steam

- Input: 🔥 Fire, 🇰🇿 Khazakistan
- Output: None

- Input: ༄.° Wind, 🌍 Earth
- Output: 🌫️ Dust


*** IMPORTANT ***
NEVER output more than 1 element at a time.
Make sure to be creative but still logically correct!!!

Air and Fire should not be equal to Lava.
Air and Stone should be Sand. As the air would erode the stone.
Sand and Stone should not be Beach but rather Sandstone.
Sand and Mud should be Clay.

Outputting [Element1], [Element2] as an element is not appropriate. Please provide a creative and logically correct response.

*** VERY IMPORTANT ***
PLEASE avoid outputting esoteric or nonsensical responses such as MoltenGypsumGlassConcrete!!!
Don't just combine words of the two elements. Try to combine the elements in a way that makes sense, while still being creative. For example, Wood and Horse could be Trojan Horse, Void and Star could be Space.
Also avoid outputting the same element as the input. For example, combining Water and Water should not give Water, and avoid outputting None as much as possible. I really want to see some creative combinations!
Remember, you should always prefer the creative solutions that follow these instructions. Only if you can't come up with it is that you should return None.

The response MUST and I mean MUST be valid string.
The only exception is if the response is None which means the combination is impossible.
If the combination is impossible the response MUST be None.
The response MUST be simple and relatively short.
